TThe DEVelopers Network: 
By Mekhi Brodie
The DEVelopers Network is a concept that brings together the community aspect of stackoverflow, the search power of Google,  and the information of The technological web all in one place. It’s designed for old and new developers alike to have all resources in one central place, disregarding the need to search a multitude of websites to find your answers. 

The PROject:

Phase 1: The search - The search aspect of the DEVelopers Network is already completed! The search aspect allows you not only to do a central search of what you're looking for, but it can filter out your search with specific, pre-included  parameters. It gives you the ability to search multiple stackoverflow results, search results just for API’s, results just for Node Modules and more without having to go to each individual website to find these answers, making it a quick and convenient way for developers to search what they're looking for. The search also includes a new feature called Tags. Tags allow you to find websites that developers found helpful to them based on keywords. In its current form, you can add Tags and view Tags that helped other developers. Currently these Tags are hard-coded, but in the future anyone will be allowed to create Tags and add them to the website. An update is also in the works that allows you to like websites that will automatically be tagged and those websites will be filtered based off of its current amount of  likes. Currently there are few limitations, for example search results are limited to specific amount which will grow in future releases. The design is also heavily being worked on to optimize user experience, And features are still being completed and worked on as we speak. 

Phase 2: The community - The community aspect is the second part in the three-part project. The community will allow you to post questions and receive answers. It will allow you to comment and engage in conversation about your topic or question and find answers quickly. A points system in place, called Boolean points, will ensure that every user is actively engaging in the community. To find the answers to your questions you will need to use a Boolean point and you gain boolean points by answering questions and engaging with the website, allowing uniformal engagement across all users. The initial goal is just to allow posts and comments, but in the future, the goal is to be able to post comments with text editors and be able to message other users. It will also connect the posts to the search, allowing you to do a uniform search across the web AND the Forum. 

Phase 3: The Cheat Sheet -  The Cheat Sheet is similar to The Forum. The Cheat Sheet will allow anyone to post tips, tricks and helpful hints about any language quickly and easily. Anything that is helpful or new or something that might be unknown to most developers will be included here. It's a community system so anyone can upload or post any relevant material. The current goal is to just implement the Cheat Sheet within the Network, but in the future, a system would be in place to filter specific Cheats and uploading a Cheat will net you a Boolean Point, further activating engagement within the community. 
The LANguages:

React: React will be the primary language used for the search. In its current form the search is 100% react, with over 1300 lines of code, half of that being just CSS, In a multitude of different components. It utilizes three different libraries in roughly 15 to 20 node modules. In its current form the search function is incredibly API heavy, with each search hitting a different unique API that is filtered and controlled.  ES6 syntax and functions, like ternaries and Map loops provide an easy, readable and updated way to view code. The state feature of react makes it easy to render conditional information without extra code. 

JavaScript/Jquery: The remainder of the DEVelopers that work is still being planned out, however vanilla JavaScript in combination with HTML or JavaScript library like jQuery is being heavily considered for the Cheat Sheet part of the project as the Cheat Sheet requires less information to be conditionally rendered. 

Current Bugs:
The sign-up and log-in features work, however logging in will not redirect you to the search. The search function does not need a login. Going to specific URLs will show the current concept for the signup and login screens when the Forum is completed signup and login will be fully implemented. 
In its current form, the search is not mobile responsive in the slightest. That is currently being worked on before we move forward
As stated above, some of the CSS for the search is still being tweaked upon. For example, the modal to create a Tag needs heavy CSS to match the design aesthetic of the website. 
The list feature is also still being worked on as we're adding more filters and creating more conditionally rendered content.
